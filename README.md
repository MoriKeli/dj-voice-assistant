## What is Xcalibur?
**Xcalibur** is a web based speech recognizer and translator built with Django in addition to other technologies.


### Website info

**Xcalibur** allows users to use text-to-speech or speech-to-text capabilities of a trained speech recognition machine learning model. Users can upload audio or video files that will be translated into their text equivalent. They can also type or copy and paste a given text that will be translated into speech. The generated speech will be saved as an audio file and automatically downloaded via a user's browser.
