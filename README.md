### Website info

#### Users can upload video or audio files that will be translated to their text equivalent. Additionally, users can also type or copy a text and paste it in a text area provided by a form - click "Get started" button to display form. Once the form is submitted, a prompt may appear (depending on the browser configurations) asking the user where to save the generated text, .srt, audio or video file. If a prompt does not appear, the generated file will be downloaded automatically.
